# AFYF
Accountable for Your Future - The app to keep you accountable when applying for jobs

# Prototype 
There will be a prototype for the app on the base design of how it looks like:
"To-be-included"

# Documentation
The goal of this project is to:
1. Getting to know and refresh my knowledge on Android - Kotlin - Android Studio as the IDE
2. Keeping myself accountable when applying for jobs, hopefully for others in the future as well

Diving into the details a little bit, will add more as I see fit:
- No need for internet connection
- There will be only handful of activity screens as this is developed for personal use as of now.
- There will be a To-Do-List feature, leet code or checklists
- There will be review/summary feature which shows graph on how many you have applied, how many interviews, what is the ratio (in the graph view) - This could be enhanced through notifications once a week / depending on the user's settings
- Personalized settings which are saved for every time you open and run the app. Can have multiple users that can be changed through the welcome screen
- An easier access or more detailed option to add a new application

Future goals:
- Hopefully this app can be personalized or editable to be used for anyone not just specifically Computer Science focused
- Hopefully the app can also scalable to just To-Do-List in general to make people accountable of general things in their life; however, this is focused on new grads / people who are looking for jobs.

# Progress
